# Seqlok

Seqlok is a real-time shared-state substrate for low-latency, multi-threaded engines.

It provides:

- Param and meter bindings over SharedArrayBuffer with seqlock-style coherence
- Lock-free SPSC command rings for cross-thread control
- A generic engine swap protocol (spawn, prime, initialize, blend, retire)

Seqlok does **not** know about audio, decks, BPM, tracks or cues.
Those live entirely in clients like Dekzer.

Audio and DSP are the first clients. The primitives are designed to work equally well for
GPU simulations, live video pipelines, physics engines or any system that needs
glitch-free transitions between stateful processors.
