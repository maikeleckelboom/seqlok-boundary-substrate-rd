# Controller, Processor, and Observer Roles

Exclave Boundary exposes separate role bindings because each side has different authority and timing pressure.

## Controller

The controller is the host-side writer for params and reader for meters. It usually lives with UI, automation, preset hydration, or orchestration code.

Controller responsibilities:

- Write scalar params with `params.set(...)` or `params.update(...)`.
- Write array params with `params.stage(...)`.
- Hydrate cold-path param state with `params.hydrate(...)`.
- Read meter snapshots for UI or host-side reporting.
- Own range policy and meter degradation options.

## Processor

The processor is the timing-sensitive runtime binding. It reads params and publishes meters inside explicit callback windows.

Processor responsibilities:

- Read params inside `params.within(...)`.
- Treat array param views as callback-scoped.
- Publish scalar meters with direct writer functions or `writer.set(...)`.
- Publish array meters with `writer.stage(...)`.
- Keep planning, allocation, validation, logging, and orchestration outside the tight loop.

## Observer

The observer is a read-only binding for telemetry, inspection, visualizers, and secondary consumers.

Observer responsibilities:

- Read param snapshots.
- Read meter snapshots.
- Use `within(...)` for coherent read windows when snapshot allocation is not appropriate.
- Avoid writes entirely.

## Choosing a Role

| Need | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Update control state from UI or host automation. | Controller |
| Read control state in a timing-sensitive loop. | Processor |
| Publish runtime meters. | Processor |
| Feed diagnostics, visualization, or a HUD. | Observer |
| Own the memory plan and backing allocation. | Owner/controller side before binding |
