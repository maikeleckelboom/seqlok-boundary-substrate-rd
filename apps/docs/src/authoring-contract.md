# Authored AST vs Runtime Contract

Authors can write nested specs because nested objects are easier to read and review:

```ts
const spec = defineSpec((api) => ({
  params: {
    filter: {
      cutoff: api.param.f32({ min: 20, max: 20_000 }),
      enabled: api.param.bool(),
    },
  },
}));
```

The runtime contract is canonical and flat:

```ts
spec.params["filter.cutoff"];
spec.params["filter.enabled"];
```

The dot-key contract is what controllers use for dynamic writes, snapshots, and deterministic layout. Processor read views also expose nested aliases for ergonomic coherent reads.

## Canonical Keys and Read Views

Authored nested paths are flattened into canonical boundary keys. Controller write APIs intentionally use those string keys because they are the stable external contract.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  authored["Authored spec shape<br/>params.time.ratio"]
  canonical["Canonical boundary key<br/>time.ratio"]
  controller["Controller write API<br/>controller.params.set(&quot;time.ratio&quot;, value)"]
  processor["Processor read view<br/>params.time.ratio"]
  backing["Shared backing<br/>stable memory slots"]

  authored -->|flattened by defineSpec| canonical
  canonical -->|stable external key| controller
  canonical -->|re-expanded for ergonomic reads| processor
  controller -->|writes| backing
  backing -->|"coherent read inside within(...)"| processor
```

Use canonical dot keys for controller writes, snapshot key lists, diagnostics, generated artifacts, and spec maps such as `spec.params["time.ratio"]`. Use nested property access in processor read examples when the read view supports it, for example `params.time.ratio` inside `within(...)`.

```ts twoslash
import { defineSpec, type ParamValues } from "@exclave/boundary";

const spec = defineSpec((api) => ({
  id: "authoring/filter",
  params: {
    filter: {
      cutoff: api.param.f32({ min: 20, max: 20_000 }),
      enabled: api.param.bool(),
      mode: api.param.enum(["lowpass", "highpass"]),
    },
  },
  meters: {
    filter: {
      peak: api.meter.f32(),
    },
  },
}));

spec.params["filter.mode"];

type ControllerParamValues = ParamValues<typeof spec>;
```

## Canonical Keys

One spec defines the boundary contract. Authored namespaces flatten to canonical dotted keys before layout, handoff, writes, snapshots, and diagnostics. A controller updates `"filter.cutoff"`; it does not need the authored nested object at runtime.

Processor reads expose nested views derived from the same spec:

```ts
processor.params.within((params) => {
  params.filter.enabled;
  params.filter.cutoff;
});
```

## Conflict Rules

A leaf and namespace cannot claim the same canonical dot key. For example, `params.engine` as a leaf conflicts with `params.engine.frame` as a descendant. This prevents ambiguous runtime memory layout.
