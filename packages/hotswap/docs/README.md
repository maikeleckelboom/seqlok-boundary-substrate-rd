# @seqlok/hotswap docs

This folder documents the Seqlok hotswap substrate.

The docs are split by ownership and artifact type:

- **Contract**: shipped protocol law (normative, present tense)
- **Implementation**: host/runtime wiring and operational integration
- **Engine**: lifecycle semantics and engine-author ABI
- **Architecture**: canonical architecture specs and boundary/categorization models
- **Migration**: historical redesign guidance (non-canon, discusses old vs new)
- **Formal**: TLA+ models, English formal specs, and reference artefacts
- **ADR**: accepted or proposed design decisions
- **Exploratory**: future-facing, non-binding design parking lot

This file is an index. It is not a second handbook.

## Start here

### If you need the shipped protocol contract

Read:

- [CONTRACT.md](./CONTRACT.md)

This is the normative contract for the supported hotswap policy surface.

### If you need to wire the runtime or driver

Read:

- [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

This covers ticket flow, runtime sequencing, orchestration, and caller responsibilities.

### If you are implementing an engine

Read in this order:

- [engine/engine-lifecycle-spec.md](./engine/engine-lifecycle-spec.md)
- [engine/engine-sdk-guide.md](./engine/engine-sdk-guide.md)

The lifecycle spec explains swap phase semantics.
The SDK guide owns the engine ABI and engine-author contract.

### If you care about formal verification

Read:

- [formal/README.md](./formal/README.md)

That document owns the formal model map, supported policy families, and TLC execution instructions.

## Supported doctrine

Seqlok hotswap currently has two separate axes.

### 1. Swap policy axis

Supported policy levels are:

- **Level 1**: `single`
- **Level 2**: `reject-busy`

Anything beyond that is not part of the shipped policy contract.

### 2. Continuity axis

Continuity is orthogonal to swap policy:

- **`aligned`**: continuity by alignment context, bounded warm-up, and crossfade
- **`persistent`**: continuity by explicit handoff snapshot, install, catchup, and guarded retire

See:

- [adr/hotswap-continuity-classes-and-persistent-handoff.md](./adr/hotswap-continuity-classes-and-persistent-handoff.md)

Do not treat continuity class as another policy level.

  Runtime and driver integration guide.

### Engine docs

- [engine/engine-lifecycle-spec.md](./engine/engine-lifecycle-spec.md)  
  Lifecycle semantics for aligned and persistent swap flows.

- [engine/engine-sdk-guide.md](./engine/engine-sdk-guide.md)  
  Engine ABI, handoff capability surface, and engine-author requirements.

### ADRs

- [adr/hotswap-multi-swap-requirements.md](./adr/hotswap-multi-swap-requirements.md)  
  Level 2 overlap policy requirements.

- [adr/hotswap-continuity-classes-and-persistent-handoff.md](./adr/hotswap-continuity-classes-and-persistent-handoff.md)  
  Orthogonal continuity-class decision for `aligned` and `persistent`.

### Architecture docs

- [architecture/projection-spine-canonical-architecture.md](./architecture/projection-spine-canonical-architecture.md)  
  Canonical architecture for the projection spine. Present-tense, normative.

- [architecture/boundary-model.md](./architecture/boundary-model.md)  
  Boundary/categorization model: control plane, publication plane, resource plane.

### Migration docs

- [architecture/migration/redesign-migration-note.md](./architecture/migration/redesign-migration-note.md)  
  Historical redesign guidance. Non-canon. Discusses what the old design got wrong and what to preserve.

### Formal bundle

- [formal/README.md](./formal/README.md)  
  Entry point for supported formal policy models, experimental models, reference artefacts, and TLC instructions.

### Exploratory material

- [exploratory/hotswap-advanced-multi-swap.md](./exploratory/hotswap-advanced-multi-swap.md)  
  Non-binding future exploration for queueing, retargeting, and richer overlap behavior.

## Ownership rules

Use these rules when editing the docs:

- `README.md` is an index only.
- `CONTRACT.md` owns shipped protocol law.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` owns host/runtime integration.
- `engine-lifecycle-spec.md` owns lifecycle semantics.
- `engine-sdk-guide.md` owns engine ABI and engine-author contract.
- `architecture/` is for canonical architecture and boundary models (present tense, normative).
- `architecture/migration/` is for historical redesign guidance (non-canon, may discuss old vs new).
- `formal/README.md` owns formal execution guidance and model map.
- `formal/primitives/` is zoned by artifact type: `specs/` (ratified), `architecture/` (design rationale), `planned/` (aspirational stubs), `tla/` (model files).
- `adr/` is for actual decisions.
- `exploratory/` is for non-binding future material.

If a concept is defined in two places, the docs are wrong.

## Editing guidance

Before adding a new doc, ask:

1. Does an existing file already own this concept?
2. Is this shipped law, implementation guidance, formal material, architecture, migration, or exploratory thinking?
3. What artifact type is this? (ratified spec, architecture note, planned stub, ADR, migration note, guide, exploratory)
4. Will this new file reduce ambiguity, or just duplicate doctrine under a new name?

Prefer fewer docs with sharper ownership.
